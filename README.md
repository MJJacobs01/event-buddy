## Development Setup

All development of this has been done via Android Studio and using the pipeline established in git.

Use Java 11 (should be the version bundled with Android Studio) for development. For running things with command line, set JAVA_HOME to it (probably in `/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jre`)
